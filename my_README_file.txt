Netpbm package include 3 image formats: ppm, pgm, pbm. 
Descriptions of these formats can be found here: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm#File_formats

This C++ project allows to take an image saved in one of these formats and "translate" into another one.

Project consists of a 'main.cpp' file and 4 classes: 1 abstract class ('Obraz') and 3 derivative classes (one for each image format).

In the repository I've already uploaded a *.ppm image for an experiment/demonstartion/testing.
